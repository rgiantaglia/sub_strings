# sub_strings
Finishing another project. I am still not sure I understand everything I did or if my method is a workaround the "correct way to do it." However, the result was as intended. I had to research different methods until I was able to arrive at the correct result. In this project I used the methods map and select to iterate through the array and the hash and used and learned the methods scan and zip. scan was used to check the dictionary words in my one single string, while zip was used to combine the dictionary array (key) and the result array (value) into my hash. Continuing to look forward to understanding and learning Ruby more! Onto the next project!
